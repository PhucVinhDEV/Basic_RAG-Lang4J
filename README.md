# Basic_RAG-Lang4J
using Easy RAG lib from Langchain4J
Easy RAG
LangChain4j has an "Easy RAG" feature that makes it as easy as possible to get started with RAG. You don't have to learn about embeddings, choose a vector store, find the right embedding model, figure out how to parse and split documents, etc. Just point to your document(s), and LangChain4j will do its magic.
